# 🔥 Thermal Intelligence Engine: Autonomous Physics-Informed Cooking Platform

**End-to-end AI decision system for precise, zero-shot autonomous cooking.**

The **Thermal Intelligence Engine** is an advanced R&D initiative that bridges the gap between thermodynamics and machine learning. Unlike traditional cooking bots that follow static recipes, this system uses Self-Supervised Learning to understand the *physics* of food, constructing a continuous "Universal Food Spectrum" to cook unclassified "mystery" ingredients with high precision.

## ✨ Features

### 🔄 End-to-End Physics Pipeline

* **🌌 Universal Food Spectrum** - Utilizes Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to map ingredients into a continuous latent space based on thermal properties rather than categorical labels.
* **🌡️ Sensor Fusion Visualization** - Validates synthetic physics data by correlating Temperature (logistic rise), Humidity (sweat curve), and Weight (linear decay) on a single timeline.
* **🧠 Masked Autoencoder Brain** - Pre-trained on 1000+ simulated sessions to learn the fundamental "grammar" of thermal dynamics before seeing any labels.
* **🛡️ Safety-Critical Anomaly Detection** - Real-time monitoring logic (MSE Loss) to detect edge cases like "Door Open" events or sensor failures.
* **🧪 Zero-Shot Inference** - Extrapolates cooking times for "Mystery Objects" using learned polynomial physics laws ($t \propto d^{1.5}$).

## 🎯 Usage Guide (Step-by-Step)

The project is divided into 5 sequential notebooks demonstrating the full R&D pipeline.

### Step 1: Data Exploration & Sensor Fusion (`1_exploration.ipynb`)

**Goal:** Validate the synthetic physics generator.

* **What it does:** Simulates a single roasting session (Session #101).
* **Visual Output:** A "Sensor Fusion" plot overlaying Temperature (Red), Humidity (Blue), and Weight (Green) to verify physical realism.
* **Ground Truth:** Visualizes the transition between Raw, Cooking, and Done stages.

### Step 2: Pretraining the Brain (`2_pretraining.ipynb`)

**Goal:** Teach the AI physics without labels (Self-Supervised Learning).

* **Technique:** Masked Autoencoder (MAE). The model hides 20% of the sensor data and tries to reconstruct it.
* **Data:** 1000 unlabeled simulated cooking sessions.
* **Output:** Saves the "Brain" (Encoder weights) to `src/smartcook/pretrained_encoder.pth`.

### Step 3: Fine-Tuning (`3_finetuning.ipynb`)

**Goal:** Apply the learned physics to a specific task (Stage Prediction).

* **Technique:** Loads the pretrained encoder, freezes it, and trains a lightweight classifier on top.
* **Result:** High accuracy prediction of cooking stages (Raw vs. Done) with minimal labeled data.

### Step 4: The "Food Map" (`4_latent_space.ipynb`)

**Goal:** Visualize how the AI "thinks" about food.

* **Process:** Feeds Chicken, Steak, and "Mystery Objects" into the frozen encoder.
* **Output:** A PCA 2D Scatter plot.
* **Insight:** You will see distinct clusters for Chicken and Steak, with "Mystery Objects" finding their own place in the physics spectrum based on density and conductivity.

### Step 5: Final POC (`5_final_poc.ipynb`)

**Goal:** The Venture Demonstration (Everything combined).

1. **Universal Food Map:** Identifies where a specific ingredient sits in the universe of possible physics profiles.
2. **Physics Extrapolation:** Uses Polynomial Regression to calculate cook time for a mystery object.
3. **Anomaly Detection:** Simulates a "Door Open" event (Temp drop) and uses the Autoencoder's reconstruction error (MSE) to trigger a "RED ALERT" in real-time.

## 📁 Generated Artifacts

The system creates the following during execution:

* **Models:** `src/smartcook/pretrained_encoder.pth` (The saved weights of the self-supervised brain).
* **Data:** `classification_mock_data` and `physics_simulation_data` are generated on the fly.
* **Visuals:**
  * Sensor Fusion Multi-Axis Plot.
  * Universal Latent Space Projection (2D).
  * Real-Time Anomaly Score Plot.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Key hyperparameters can be adjusted inside the notebooks or `src/config.py`:
```python
# AI Configuration
BATCH_SIZE = 32
LEARNING_RATE = 0.001
MAX_EPOCHS = 500
PATIENCE = 15
DEVICE = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'

# Physics Constants
MAX_TEMP = 250.0   # Normalization factor
MAX_HUMIDITY = 100.0
MAX_WEIGHT = 1000.0
```

## 🎯 What Makes This Different

❌ **What It's NOT:**

* A recipe database or cookbook app.
* A simple timer based on weight.
* A generic image classifier (e.g., "Hotdog / Not Hotdog").

✅ **What It IS:**

* A **First-Principles AI** that understands thermodynamics.
* A **Zero-Shot** system capable of cooking completely novel ingredients.
* A **Safety-Critical** architecture designed for autonomous hardware.
* A **Scientific Tool** for analyzing food material properties.
